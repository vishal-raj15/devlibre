This is a note for the backend project in javascript 

REST : when ever we surf a good website they may have been using rest, which means 
    that -> respresentation state response
    things like -> creating deleting reading updating or stuf like these.

we use actions like get post act put delete

MVC:
. how user get data -> requesting to controller(which handles request)
controller -> model to get data -> view handle representation.


using router folder to manage controllers.

EJS files are more simpler to handle a single html boiler plate rather than mulptiple html pages
